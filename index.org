* Code Decomposition
** Class game
   An object of this class when initallized, sets up the startup
   screen, and initialises the class variables. This class has the
   following functions
*** start():
It displays the instruction screen.
*** type1(),type2(),type3()
It creates the design of *ROBOT* selected by the user...The game gives
3 design choices to the user
*** funckey()
It deals with the movements of the robot.
*** play()
It processes the input keys and transfers the control to the funckey()
function for the movement of the robot.
*** robo()
This function checks if level is successfully cleared or not . If yes
, then it creates ine more level and calls the play() function.
** Class selectrobo
It initialises the select robo screen and takes input from the user ,
the type of robot user wants to choose. There are *3 robot choices*. 
* Advantages of program design
  With proper use of classes, encapsulation the main function needs to
  call on one function of both classes which in turn call other
  functions within themselves.
  /Systematic design which ensures proper understanding/
* Control flow
 The main game code resides in the =201101015_robot.py= file.This file first import all the required library .
 Firslty an object of class game is created,initialises the =loading=
 screen and after that start() function is called which creates the
 instruction screen .This screen waits for some time so that one can
 read instructions. Then the object of class select robo is created
 which when created initialises the screen to choose the robots.Then
 robo() function of the game class is called which in turn calls the
 play() function and sets levels of game.
 If =p = key is pressed it =pauses= the game by entering into a while
 loop which breaks when =any ARROW= is pressed again.A count of 
 bomb and diffuse codes is mainted when all diffuse codes are collected and then all bomb are collected the next level begins.
 Flags are set accordingly to bomb and diffuse code count.If number
 flag = =1 or 2= game ends.Pressing the =ESC= key will quit the game. 

 If the player is unsuccessful, the code a
 =SORRY YOUR GAME IS OVER= message is displayed . Otherwise, a
 =!!!!CONGRATULATIONS YOU WIN !!!!!! message= is displayed.
